Establishing Ourselves as a Branch
----------------------------------

### The University of York

Our main aim is to get a stall at The University of York's ``Fresher's Fair''. 
To do this, we would need to have at least 3 people who are students at the 
university to setup a university society (soc). 

We will need to drum up support for us at the university to get this level of 
involvement, some ideas are:

  * Give talks at various societies, Leanne has already given a talk to the New 
    Generation Society. Other ideas include:

      + FragSoc, the computer gaming society. Perhaps Jamie Garside 
        (slugonamission) would be a good person to contact.
      + Philosophy Society, Persephone knows some people who may be able to 
        help
      + HackSoc, the computer science enthusiasts,
      + The Debating Society,
      + The Freedom Society, Leanne has contacted these people, but arranging
        a meeting has been difficult so far

  * Flyering around campus. 
  
      + Poster boards: If we wanted to post in the big closed off
        poster boards, our posters would almost always need approval from the 
        porters. This is not a formal procedure, but one to be aware of. 
      + If we can get buy-in from some of the societies, many of them have 
        their own notice boards which are largely un-regulated.
      + NightLine used to simply turn up en masse with posters and cover 
        various bits of campus, for example, the inside of toilet doors. We 
        could do something similar, but a bit less intrusive? We may need to 
        speak to the university admin about this to keep relations friendly.


Some postering ideas:

  * ``Do You Know Your Digital Rights?'' 
  * ``Do You Have an Interest in Freedom of Speech? Meet us in V-Bar at 8PM on 
    Thursday''

### The Branch Itself

The members of the branch will meet at least monthly, but ideally once every 
two weeks.
