Overview
========

In this article, which is adapted from a talk delivered to The University of
York Philosophy Society, is an overview of the main arguments typically made 
from the proponents of personal privacy in the modern world.

It explores the more common "Nothing to Hide" argument, in which those who 
believe in state or corporate surveillance claim that, if a person has nothing
to hide (that is, they are not engaging in illegal or immoral activities), then
they have nothing to fear. Put simply and more commonly, "If you have nothing 
to hide, then you have nothing to fear"

We explore this argument in the simplest and a much more complex form, and 
present an overview of several existing counter-arguments and counter-examples.

This article will leave out a huge debate which deals with other difficulties
surrounding privacy. These difficulties primarily revolve around the trouble 
that philosophers have had over even reaching a consistent definition of 
privacy, and the numerous issues that this causes for legislators, jurors, etc.

The Need for Privacy
====================

The human need for privacy has been quite thoroughly explored for quite a long
time, even as far back as the Greek philosophers, who divided life into two 
distinct "spheres"; the "political sphere" where everything you did or said
was expected to be public knowledge, used for making political decisions, for 
example, during an election. The "intimate sphere" was expected to be 
reserved for close family and friends, where things you did or said were 
expected to stay private. 

In the 18^th^ and 19^th^ century, Jeremy Bentham published his *"Panopticon 
Writings"* (1787), which explored the idea of removing a person's privacy as a
method of punishment, and a coercive tool in his imagined "panopticon". The 
Panopticon was a prison designed such that a warden would, at all tines, be 
able to observe any prisoner of their choosing.

Bentham argued that this was ideal for a prison, as it would ensure that no 
prisoner could ever "step out of line" and therefore, if the prisoner wanted
a pleasant life, would behave as the model prisoner in all observable respects.

Curiously, Bentham also in his *Panopticon Writings* also brings about the simple
issue with this setup. He expresses it as *quis custodiet ipsos custodes?*, 
which translates literally to "Who guards the guards?" or more idiomatically:
*"Who watches the watchmen?"*, which many readers will be familiar with.

In short, Bentham argues that a removal of privacy leads to improved control of
those who are watched, and that this is an ideal tool for a prison.

The idea of the removal has also been explored in fiction, in Franz Kafka's 
*The Trial*, in George Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, Huxely's *A Brave New 
World*, Ray Bradbury's *Fahrenheit 451*, Philip K. Dick's *A Scanner Darkly* and 
many of Cory Doctorow's books. 

Almost invariably, these are set in some form of dystopia, which could be a 
reflection on how strongly these authors fear the control that a state or a 
corporation may choose to impose on their lives, should their privacy be taken 
away.

Unfortunately, this is not just a thought experiment. Several states have 
experimented with removing their citizen's rights to privacy, leading to severe
human rights breaches. The major ones of the 20^th^ century which spring to 
mind are the Nazis and the Stasi of East Germany. Many people who lived with 
these regimes and secret police forces are now advocates of strong privacy 
laws.

Nothing To Hide 
===============

Typically, this argument comes in one of two forms. A simple and a complex 
form, which has many simple and obvious retorts which render it unusable as
an argument in open debate. We will breifly outline the simple example, and
it's retorts, followed by the more complex version of this argument, and the 
retorts to it.

The Simple Argument
-------------------

The simple argument is literally "If you have nothing to hide, then it follows
that you must have nothing to fear."

This makes several serious oversights, and especially since it is typically 
brought out as an argument for measures to protect people, there are some
problems with it:

  * It is an expression of a personal opinion: You don't fear the sate,
    because your views typically align with the views of the state. This does
    not mean that your views can be expanded to the whole populace.

  * It makes no distinction as to who sees any information about your person.

  * The argument makes no concessions for the vulnerable, for example, children
    or the disabled.

  * There is an assumption that privacy has no value to anyone.

  * It is a subtle *ad hominen* attack; the implication being that the opponent
    to the argument is some form of criminal, or that they have something to 
    hide, which is an assumed negative by the argument.

  * A *false dichotomy* can quickly be constructed, wherein, one can only have 
    privacy or security, but not both. This is not the case.

Simply put, this basic version of the argument is extremely weak, and does not
stand up to a cursory inspection.

The Extended Argument
---------------------

In more modern circles, there is a much more advanced form of the argument,
which is more difficult to deflect, however, there do exist retorts. 
Unfortunately, these retorts and concerns are often derided by surveillance
proponents are mere "paranoia". 

The modern, extended version of the argument usually revolves around a few 
salient points:

  * Only "essential" data will be collected

  * It will be *automatically filtered*, thereby ensuring that the majority of
    the data is *not* seen by humans

  * The humans that do see the data will not care about any "embarrassing" data 
    they may be exposed to.

  * It is unlikely that any one person who is checking the output of the data 
    will see the information of a person who they personally know.

Attacking this form of the argument is much harder. At first glance, it seems 
to balance the needs of privacy with the needs of security, which mostly 
eliminates the false dichotomy issue, it ensures only those who are some how
"trustworthy" only see any data which is deemed suspicious, it allows for 
privacy to be valued by many people, and ensures that (by and large) the only
people who have their privacy violated are those who are some how suspicious.

However, this argument does have some serious issues. Firstly, it assumes that
everyone with access to the data (Law enforcement officers, system 
administrators, judges, court officials, etc.) are perfect and benevolent. This
is known to be false, as humans are only human! People make mistakes and leave 
CDs of data on trains, some police officers take bribes, and so on. We also 
now know that data from security agencies has been used in ways that breach the
remit of the program, for instance:

  * KGB surveillance programs were used extensively to harass and discredit any
    political opponents.

  * Many municipal registries in countries occupied by the Nazis were used to
    hunt down the Jewish populations and send them to concentration camps to be
    murdered.

  * The FBI used its surveillance programs to harass Martin Luther King Jr, 
    even going so far as to attempt to black mail him, and purportedly writing 
    him at least one letter urging him to kill himself.

Clearly, the assumption that those with access to the data *right now* are 
trustworthy is false, human history shows this to be the case. However, we also
know that if the data isn't "just" sniffed, that is, if it is not ephemeral, 
then the data must stay around in some form for a length of time. Since you do 
not control the laws of the future, you do not know when that data will be 
abused.

Data can also be fabricated to discredit a person. This relates to the 
trustworthiness of individuals, but it if the system is regarded as "gospel", 
then anyone who is a target may have data about them created in order to 
discredit or harass them. This is quite closely related to the fact that data 
could also be in error, leading to an unnecessary and potentially intrusive
investigation. And usually, once an allegation has been made against a person,
in the community's mind, they are always potentially guilty.

The automated sniffing will likely have a few issues. Firstly, how does the 
state plan to process that much data efficiently? How long will the data be 
stored for? Who exactly will see the data, and how will the security of the 
data be ensured?

However, those are "only" practical concerns. There are much deeper concerns
with this system.

Who determines what constitutes suspicious behaviour? In the aftermath of
the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings, many people would not of even heard of 
"pressure cooker bombs" and would likely have looked up what this means, 
and if they are common weapons. Should this mean that they should be 
subject to an investigation, simply because they are curious about current
affairs?

Due to *Bayes' Theorem*, if there is a low incidence of those in society who 
are actually a threat worthy of investigation, then there will be a 
disproportionate number of false-positives. That is, a very large number of
otherwise "normal" or "innocent" people will be flagged for investigation,
which is a violation of an innocent person's privacy and could lead to more 
invasive forms of surveillance or even arrest. This diverts resources from 
where they are really necessary. It also means that the system cannot hope 
to catch all threats, as a few will invariably slip through the net and wreak 
havoc.

Conclusion
==========

This argument can actually be characterised by a simple observation. That is 
that proponents of privacy typically value long term security from the state 
and any other potentially "controlling" entities, whereas proponents of 
surveillance typically value short term security against a vague threat over
a very real threat to privacy, which they do not deem to have any value.

Overall, the Pirate Party typically sides with the proponents of privacy, 
usually citing the above arguments, along with the questionable efficacy of 
more pedestrian forms of surveillance (e.g. CCTV). I feel that I have to side
with them, privacy is one of the pillars of democracy; without it the ability 
to freely dissent against the state is severely limited, and human rights 
violations become almost inevitable -- especially when surveillance is carried
out at scale.
