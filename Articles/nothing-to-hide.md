Overview
========

Adapted from a talk delivered to The University of
York Philosophy Society, this article is an overview of the main arguments typically made 
from the proponents of personal privacy in the modern world. It explores the 
more common "Nothing to Hide" argument, in which those who believe in state or 
corporate surveillance claim that "if you have nothing to hide, then you have 
nothing to fear." However, this argument makes large assumptions as to the meaning
of "nothing to hide", the purpose of privacy and how it applies within our legal and moral
frameworks, and so in this article we will explore the various aspects of privacy and surveillance,  
and present an overview of several existing counter-arguments and counter-examples.

This article will leave out a huge debate which deals with other difficulties
surrounding privacy. These difficulties primarily revolve around the trouble 
that philosophers have had over even reaching a consistent definition of 
privacy, and the numerous issues that this causes for legislators, jurors, and common people. Although 
this might seem like rather a large oversight, and certainly a natural starting point for such a debate,
I considered it a greater imperative to arrive at a useful conclusion and circumvent the centuries of debate necessary
to settle these conflicts of public interest, definition and logically consistent application, which are
issues philosophy itself may take to its grave.  

The Need for Privacy
====================

The human need for privacy has been quite thoroughly explored for quite a long
time, even as far back as the Greek philosophers, who divided life into two 
distinct "spheres": the "political" and the "intimate." The political sphere was one in which 
everything you did or said was expected to be public knowledge, used for making political decisions, for 
example, during an election. By contrast, the intimate sphere was expected to be 
reserved for close family and friends, where things you did or said were 
expected to stay private. A simple distinction, but one that seems to have eluded us in recent years.

In 1787, Jeremy Bentham published his *"Panopticon 
Writings"*, which explored the idea of removing a person's privacy as a
method of punishment, and a coercive tool in his imagined "panopticon". The 
Panopticon was a glass-panelled prison designed such that a warden would, at all times, be 
able to observe any prisoner of their choosing, whilst ensuring this total lack of privacy was 
palpable to the unfortunate prisoners. Picture the Big Brother house in 18th century England, 
and you get the idea. Bentham argued that this was the ideal design for a prison, as it would ensure that no 
prisoner could ever "step out of line" and therefore, if the prisoner wanted
a pleasant life, would behave as the model prisoner in all observable respects. Unable to hide, the prisoner
necessarily must fear inevitable punishment for any misbehaviour. 

Interestingly, Bentham addresses the logical conclusion of this setup, expressing it as *quis custodiet ipsos custodes?*, 
literally "Who guards the guards?" or more idiomatically: *"Who watches the watchmen?"*. For this constant surveillance to work, we 
must presume the ultimate authority is completely, flawlessly benevolent, and if that were the case for our species, we 
wouldn't need to discuss the usefulness of surveillance in deterring crime and curbing undesirable human behaviour. 


However,the idea of the removal of privacy extends beyond rhetoric, into the many worlds of fiction. A brief overview of 
some of the best explorations of the topic include Franz Kafka's *The Trial*, in George Orwell's *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, Huxely's *A Brave New 
World*, Ray Bradbury's *Fahrenheit 451*, Philip K. Dick's *A Scanner Darkly* and many of Cory Doctorow's books. 

A chillingly common factor in all these narratives is their dystopian setting, often inferring authoritarian forms of goverment
and an unhappy, mindless and impotent society, which could be a 
reflection on how strongly these authors fear the control that a state or a 
corporation may choose to impose on their lives, should their privacy be taken 
away.

Unfortunately, this is not just a thought experiment. Several states have 
experimented with removing their citizen's rights to privacy, leading to severe
human rights breaches. The major ones of the 20^th^ century which spring to 
mind are the Nazis and the Stasi of East Germany. However, although the Nazis are the 
poster party for barbaric and unforgiveable human rights violations and unforgiving
governance of the German people, our own governments are turning their techniques on their
citizens, using thinly-veiled excuses such as safety, security, and the "nothing to hide" argument.

Nothing To Hide 
===============

Typically, this argument comes in one of two forms, which I will call simple and extended. 
Here's a brief outline of each form, and some retorts which highlight the flaws of each argument.

The Simple Argument
-------------------

The simple argument is literally "If you have nothing to hide, then it follows
that you must have nothing to fear."

This makes several serious oversights, and especially since it is typically 
brought out as an argument for measures to protect people, there are some
problems with it:

  * It is an expression of a personal opinion: You don't fear the sate,
    because your views typically align with the views of the state. This does
    not mean that your views can be expanded to the whole populace. You only need
    to look as far as Facebook to see that we all have different ideas of what
    we feel comfortable sharing, and who with; for some, every relationship change
    necessitates a public broadcast, whereas others carefully edit their online persona:
    it's all a matter of perspective. 	

  * It makes no distinction as to who sees any information about your person. "Information" 
    isn't necessarily abstract; so, for example, you might be perfectly happy to share
    physical information about your naked body with your partner or spouse, but not so
    much with your boss or mother-in-law.

  * The argument makes no concessions for the vulnerable, for example, children
    or the disabled. 

  * There is an assumption that privacy has no value to anyone aside from as a protection from punishment.

  * It is a subtle *ad hominen* attack. "Ad hominen" essentially refers to attacking the speaker,
    not the words or arguments they use; here, the implication is that anyone pro-privacy has 
    something to hide, and carries with it connotations of immorality and illegality.

  * A *false dichotomy* can quickly be constructed, wherein, one can only have 
    privacy or security, but not both. This is not the case, as there are plenty 
    of ways to maintain security without impinging on civil liberties, and there 
    are many arguments which discredit the effectiveness of surveillance on crime reduction.

Simply put, this basic version of the argument is extremely weak, and does not
stand up to even a cursory inspection.

The Extended Argument
---------------------

In more modern circles, there is a much more advanced form of the argument, 
which takes into account the advances we have made in technology, and the kind of 
surveillance we are able to conduct. These arguments essentially try to negate the individual impact
of surveillance, and make it seem as though surveillance doesn't necessarily interfere with the 
privacy of individuals, on what is assumed to be an "important" level. Some examples of this attempt to
justify surveillance and show it in harmony with privacy (at least for those with "nothing to hide") are as follows:  
 

  * Only "essential" data will be collected (though the lack of definition here is not due to my time constraints:
    this point is rarely clarified, and the ambiguity, when this is used to sift through our personal information, is daunting).

  * It will be *automatically filtered*, thereby ensuring that the majority of
    the data is *not* seen by humans. However, knowing my information is handled electronically isn't any better: it just 
    tells me that the data is more permanently stored.

  * The humans that do see the data will not care about any "embarrassing" data 
    they may be exposed to. Whilst I applaud their apparent impartialism, this is not really a comfort.

  * It is unlikely that any one person who is checking the output of the data 
    will see the information of a person who they personally know. Again, not a comfort; although 
    the information we share is often dependent on the context of our relationship with the other party 
    (e.g. our spouse or mother-in-law), the complete lack of a personal relationship does not make me comfortable 
    to share certain information about myself.

Attacking this form of the argument is much harder. At first glance, it seems 
to balance the needs of privacy with the needs of security, 
eliminating the false dichotomy issue by it ensuring only those who are
"trustworthy" can handle the data, and that even then, only "suspicious" data is targeted. Essentially, this is
the setup of the panopticon: the infallible and benevolent watch the criminal and suspicious, and everyone else is left
alone. However, as we neither have perfectly benevolent humans to do the watching, nor a perfect system for filtering
what information is deemed "suspicious" or "safe", this balancing act is ultimately flawed, and the dichotomy is restored. For the curious,
*Bayes' Theorem* discusses the problem of false positives in any sweeping search of information, and how this effects society in much
larger ways, having a knock-on effect in the way we treat suspects, who is identified as such, and how much time we waste following red
herrings based on mass surveillance. However, if you're more into your history than maths, there are other ways to see the potential havoc
widespread data collection has caused. Examples of the potential misuse for this data are numerous, but here are a few more poignant ones:

  * KGB surveillance programs were used extensively to harass and discredit any
    political opponents.

  * Many municipal registries in countries occupied by the Nazis were used to
    hunt down the Jewish populations and send them to concentration camps to be
    murdered.

  * The FBI used its surveillance programs to harass Martin Luther King Jr, 
    even going so far as to attempt to black mail him, and purportedly writing 
    him at least one letter urging him to kill himself.


As well as human fallibility, there are also technical difficulties to be explored 
and considered when it comes to the automated sifting of information. How do we 
plan to process that much data efficiently? How long will the data be 
stored for? Who exactly will see the data, and how will the security of the 
data be ensured?

The practical and moral implications are far-reaching, and the effectiveness of invasive surveillance is questionable at best. However,
there are also some disturbing observations to make as to the demographic split between those in favour, and those against, the all-seeing
eyes of CCTV, Prism, and the panoptic society. 

Conclusion
==========

Privacy proponents value the human rights of dignity, privacy and autonomy, whilst expecting the state to provide protection
from the evils of the world; however, surveillance proponents fear that privacy grants a hiding space for wannabe terrorists. 
However, without privacy, we lose our humanity. Our ability to think and express freely is impeded by the idea of being watched
by the powers that be. In short, if we are all being watched, we cannot help but fear punishment for misbehaviour; but where suspicion
is not a well-defined, it is impossible to know when we will be punished, and what for: we simply must hope that our transparent thoughts
are not treated as misdemeanours by the authorities that watch us. 

If the watchmen are immune to being watched, then the system is inherently flawed in its hypocrisy; until we are a perfect society
with no need to watch each others' behaviour, then there should be no watchmen at all.
